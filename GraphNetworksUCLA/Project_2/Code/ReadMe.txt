			    Introduction

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Project #2 as a requirement for EE232E Graphs and Network Flow course.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

			    Requirements

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Following are the system requirements for the execution of this script :

1) Windows 7/8/ Mac OSX
2) R (3.3)
3) RStudio, Python
3) Intel Processor
4) igraph library
5) plyr library
6) data.table library

Since, this project is based on Big Data, we implemented it on the server having 128 GB RAM for fast results. Though it is possible to run it on normal Laptop, but the time to finish is quite huge. So, we recommend that the code should be run on server for fast results. Thats why, RAM is not a requirement but, a good suggestion.

			      Configuration

--------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no configuration for the script.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

			      Installation

--------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the script, please follow the below steps:


Windows :

1) Please make sure R and igraph are installed on the machine.
2) We have used different platforms to do the text processing and generate the plots and graph objects. The zip file contains the code for every question and we just have to load the library once and run the  question sequentially to avoid any graph object contention.
