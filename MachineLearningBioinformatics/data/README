1. Chromosome 22 of 1000 genomes
Other chromosomes can be obtained on request

Files:
*************
A)
chr-22.geno
Binary matrix of genotypes
Rows=SNPs
Columns=Individuals
(i,j)=1 implies individual carries allele 1

This is haploid data.
Since each individual is diploid, the two homologous chromosomes of a single individual correspond to two columns in this file
1=> Genotype carries the reference allele


*************
B)
chr-22.snp
One line for each SNP. 6 columns per line
1: SNP ID
2: chromsome number
3: genetic position
4: physical position
5: allele 1 (reference)
6: allele 2
 
*************
C)
chr-22.ind
One line for each individual. 3 columns per line

1: Individual ID
2: Sex M/F/U (U=unknown)
3: Population ID 


This dataset has 14 populations, 1092 individuals and ~400K SNPs.
